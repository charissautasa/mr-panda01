    "The column(s) to use as the key for merging. Both DataFrames must have this column.\n",

    "Use different columns from the left and right DataFrames as keys.\n",

    "\n",
    "- left_index and right_index -\n",
    "Use the index of the left or right DataFrame as the key.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- sort -\n",

    "#### Variables Explanation\n",
    "In this project, the following variables were used to analyze and merge datasets related to superheroes and their publishers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. superheroes DataFrame\n",
    "Purpose: Stores information about superheroes, including their names, alignments, genders, and publishers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "name: The name of the superhero (e.g., \"Batman\", \"Iron Man\"). Data type: string.\n",
    "\n",
    "alignment: The moral alignment of the superhero (e.g., \"good\", \"bad\"). Data type: string.\n",
    "\n",
    "gender: The gender of the superhero (e.g., \"male\", \"female\"). Data type: string.\n",
    "\n",
    "publisher: The publisher of the superhero (e.g., \"DC\", \"Marvel\"). Data type: string.\n",
    "\n",
    "source: The source of the superhero (e.g., \"comic\", \"movie\"). Data type: string. This variable was added to handle compound keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. publishers DataFrame\n",
    "Purpose: Stores information about publishers, including their names and founding years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "publisher: The name of the publisher (e.g., \"DC\", \"Marvel\"). Data type: string.\n",
    "\n",
    "year_founded: The year the publisher was founded (e.g., 1934, 1939). Data type: integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Variable Relationships\n",
    "The publisher column is shared between the superheroes and publishers DataFrames, making it the key for merging. Without this variable, the datasets could not be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source column was added to handle cases where the same character exists in multiple sources (e.g., Iron Man in comics vs. movies). This ensures that the merged data is accurate and meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Advanced Analysis\n",
    "The variables can be used for advanced analyses, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping superheroes by alignment to compare the number of \"good\" vs. \"bad\" characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering publishers based on year_founded to analyze trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How could you handle a Compound Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A compound key is a combination of multiple columns used as the key for merging. This is useful when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify rows, and you need to combine multiple columns to create a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Handle a Compound Key:\n",
    "1. Identify the Columns for the Compound Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine which columns, when combined, will uniquely identify rows in your dataset. For example, if you have superheroes from different sources (e.g., comics vs. movies), you might use both the publisher and source columns as a compound key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the Necessary Columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the columns for the compound key don't already exist, create them. For example, add a source column to differentiate between comic book characters and movie characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Merge Using the Compound Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the pd.merge() function and specify the compound key by passing a list of column names to the on parameter (or use left_on and right_on if the column names differ between DataFrames).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Validate the Merge:\n",
    "\n",
    "After merging, check the resulting DataFrame to ensure the compound key worked as expected. You can use the validate parameter in pd.merge() to ensure the merge type (e.g., one_to_one, one_to_many, etc.).\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Merging on the Compound Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pd.merge() function is used to merge the superheroes and publishers DataFrames. The on='publisher' parameter specifies that the merge should be based on the publisher column. If you wanted to use a compound key (e.g., publisher and source), you would pass a list of column names to the on parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "The merged DataFrame will now include rows that match both the publisher and source columns, ensuring that characters from different sources (e.g., comics vs. movies) are treated as distinct entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points to Address the Feedback:\n",
    "How to Handle a Compound Key: You need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the columns that will form the compound key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensure those columns exist in both DataFrames (or create them if necessary).\n",
